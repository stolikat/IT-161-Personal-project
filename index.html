    Mount Rainier, standing at 14,411 feet, is the highest peak in the Cascade Range and the Pacific Northwest. It is an active stratovolcano with over two dozen major glaciers, making it the most glaciated peak in the contiguous United States. Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world due to its potential for lahars (volcanic mudflows) threatening nearby populated areas like Tacoma and Seattle.

    Located in northern California, Mount Shasta rises to 14,179 feet. It is an active stratovolcano with four overlapping cones and a long history of eruptions. The mountain holds spiritual significance for Native American tribes and has been a source of mystical folklore and legends. Its last major eruption occurred in the 18th century, and geologists expect it will erupt again in the future.

    Mount Adams, reaching 12,281 feet, is the second-highest mountain in Washington State. It is a dormant stratovolcano with no recorded eruptions in recent history. The mountain features large lava flows and is popular for hiking and backcountry skiing. Its relatively gentle slopes make it one of the more accessible Cascade peaks to climb.

    Mount Hood is Oregon’s tallest mountain at 11,239 feet and is considered an active stratovolcano. Although its last significant eruption occurred in the 1860s, there are fumaroles and steam vents near the summit that indicate ongoing volcanic activity. Mount Hood is a major recreational destination and is home to the only year-round ski resort in North America.

    Glacier Peak, standing at 10,541 feet, is one of the most remote and least visible major volcanoes in the Cascades. Despite its low profile, it is an active stratovolcano with a violent eruptive history, particularly during the last 15,000 years. Due to its location in wilderness terrain, it is less visited but closely monitored by geologists.

    Mount Baker, located in northern Washington near the Canadian border, rises to 10,786 feet. It is an active volcano and is known for receiving some of the highest annual snowfall totals in the world. Baker's Sherman Crater frequently emits steam, and the volcano last erupted in the 19th century. It remains a focus of scientific study and a favorite among mountaineers and skiers.

    Mount St. Helens is perhaps the most famous peak in the Cascade Range due to its catastrophic 1980 eruption. The eruption reduced its height from 9,677 feet to 8,366 feet and created a massive crater. It remains an active volcano with frequent earthquakes and dome-building eruptions. The 1980 eruption was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in U.S. history.
